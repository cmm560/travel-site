Monks invented Pastéis de Nata in Belém centuries ago, but they’re as relevant today as they were when crafty clergymen concocted the heavenly Portuguese desserts.",

Piri Piri Chicken is a great example of this phenomenon, blending global flavors from former African colonies with local Portuguese products.",

                "Vinho Verde: This wine was one of the first Portuguese wines exported to European markets. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the wines from the Minho Valley and the Lima Valley were regularly transported to northern Europe in the same boats that brought bacalhau (salt cod) and manufactured products.

                "Cherry Shots: Trying ginjinha in Lisbon is a travel must. Also known as ginja, this is a sweet liqueur made from Morello (sour) cherries soaked in a distilled spirit called aguardente. The mixture is flavored with sugar and spices like cinnamon. It is deceptively sweet, small, and packs a punch. (https://devourtours.com/blog/ginjinha-lisbon/?cnt=US#:~:text=Trying%20ginjinha%20in%20Lisbon%20is,small%2C%20and%20packs%20a%20punch.)",
                "Licor Beirão: Licor Beirão, also known in short simply as Beirão, advertises itself as “Portugal’s liquer”. It may not be the liquer, but it certainly is one of the most popular ones. The name speaks of the origins of this distilled drink, in the Beiras region of Portugal. If you are a fan of sweet drinks, the secret mix of herbs, cinnamon, mint, lavender, rosemary, and cardamom you will find in Beirão is sure to tickle your fancy. Licor Beirão can be downed as it is but, because of its intensely sweet nature, it goes well with plenty of ice. (https://www.tasteoflisboa.com/blog/10-typical-drinks-from-portugal/)"
